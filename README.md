# Android Showcase
This project was created as a part of the Android MIPT course, 10/2020.  
The requirements were as follows:
* Load 100 questions from StackOverflow with the
"Android" tag, save them to the database and display them.
* If the Internet is turned off, then show the questions saved in the database.
* By clicking on the question, a second screen with the answers opens.
